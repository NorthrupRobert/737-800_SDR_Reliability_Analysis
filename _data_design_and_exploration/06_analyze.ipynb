    "⭐ Step 1 — Start with ATA Frequency (What fails the most?)\n",
    "\n",
    "This answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Which systems generate the most SDRs?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Which systems dominate maintenance workload?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Which systems are chronic vs. rare?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your baseline operational picture.\n",
    "⭐ Step 2 — Overlay Severity (Which failures matter the most?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now combine:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA grounding rate\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA emergency/divert rate\n",
    "\n",
    "    AOG rate\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you a risk matrix:\n",
    "High Frequency\tHigh Severity\tAction\n",
    "High\tHigh\tCritical reliability issue\n",
    "High\tLow\tChronic nuisance / maintenance burden\n",
    "Low\tHigh\tSafety‑sensitive rare events\n",
    "Low\tLow\tBackground noise\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you start seeing patterns like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA 27 (Flight Controls) → High severity + moderate frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA 21 (Air Conditioning) → High frequency + moderate severity\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA 29 (Hydraulics) → High severity\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA 53–57 (Structures) → High structural rate but low operational impact\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first layer of insight.\n",
    "⭐ Step 3 — Add Time (Is it getting better or worse?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you look at:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA frequency over time\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA severity over time\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA keyword flags over time\n",
    "\n",
    "This answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Is ATA 21 trending upward?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Did ATA 27 spike after a fleet modification?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Are structural write‑ups seasonal?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Did a maintenance program change reduce ATA 29 events?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you start telling a story.\n",
    "⭐ Step 4 — Add Failure Modes (Why is it happening?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your keyword flags are a failure mode classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets you break down each ATA into:\n",
    "\n",
    "    fire/smoke/odor events\n",
    "\n",
    "    hydraulic leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "    electrical faults\n",
    "\n",
    "    intermittent issues\n",
    "\n",
    "    structural cracks/corrosion\n",
    "\n",
    "    pressurization events\n",
    "\n",
    "    fuel system issues\n",
    "\n",
    "    flight control binding/stuck/uncommanded\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the heatmap becomes powerful:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA 21 → odor/smoke cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA 27 → flight control binding cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA 29 → hydraulic pressure/quantity cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATA 53–57 → structural crack/corrosion cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "This is root cause pattern recognition.\n",
    "⭐ Step 5 — Add JASC (Subsystem granularity)\n",
    "\n",
    "ATA tells you what system.\n",
    "JASC tells you which component.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Which specific subsystems drive ATA 21 events?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Which JASC codes dominate ATA 27 failures?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Which JASC codes correlate with AOG events?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Which JASC codes correlate with fire/odor?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the level where airlines decide:\n",
    "\n",
    "    whether to issue a fleet campaign\n",
    "\n",
    "    whether to adjust maintenance intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "    whether to escalate to engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "    whether to contact the OEM\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actionable reliability engineering.\n",
    "⭐ Step 6 — Combine Everything Into a Reliability Narrative\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the part you’re unsure about — and it’s the part that matters most.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not just stare at graphs.\n",
    "You do not just compute cumulative metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "You synthesize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what that looks like:\n",
    "Example Insight 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    “ATA 21 (Air Conditioning) shows a high rate of fire/odor events (0.67), with a rising trend over the last 12 months. JASC 2130 and 2150 dominate the pattern, suggesting PACK overheat and air distribution issues. Recommend reviewing PACK maintenance intervals and bleed air contamination procedures.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Insight 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    “ATA 27 (Flight Controls) shows a high structural and failure rate, with 84% of events containing flight control keywords. JASC 2730 and 2750 are overrepresented. Recommend targeted inspection of elevator and spoiler control linkages.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Insight 3\n",
    "\n",
    "    “ATA 29 (Hydraulics) has the highest emergency/divert rate (0.49). Most events contain hydraulic pressure/quantity keywords. This is a safety‑critical ATA and should be escalated.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Insight 4\n",
    "\n",
    "    “Structural ATAs (53–57) show extremely high structural keyword rates (0.65–0.86), consistent with corrosion and crack findings. These are chronic but low‑severity events.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what your project is building toward.\n",
    "⭐ Step 7 — Build a Reliability Dashboard (Your Portfolio Deliverable)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final deliverable should include:\n",
    "1. ATA Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Bar chart or table.\n",
    "2. ATA Severity\n",
    "\n",
    "AOG, emergency, divert rates.\n",
    "3. ATA Trends Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Line charts.\n",
    "4. Keyword Heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure mode distribution by ATA.\n",
    "5. JASC Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Top JASC codes per ATA.\n",
    "6. Insights Section\n",
    "\n",
    "A written narrative summarizing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    what’s failing\n",
    "\n",
    "    how often\n",
    "\n",
    "    how severe\n",
    "\n",
    "    how it’s trending\n",
    "\n",
    "    why it’s happening\n",
    "\n",
    "    what subsystems drive it\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the part that makes your project analyst‑level."
